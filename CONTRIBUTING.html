<h1 id="contributing-to-slate">Contributing to Slate</h1>

<p>Thanks for contributing to Slate! A couple of quick guidelines for submitting PRs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Please point your pull requests at the <code class="prettyprint">dev</code> branch, and keep your commit messages clear and informative.</li>
<li>Please make sure your contributions work in the most recent version of Chrome, Firefox, and IE.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re implementing a new feature, even if it&rsquo;s relatively small, it&rsquo;s nice to open an issue before you start so that others know what you&rsquo;re working on and can help make sure you&rsquo;re on the right track.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks again! Happy coding.</p>
